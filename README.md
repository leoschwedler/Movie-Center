# üé¨ MoviesApp - TheMovieDB Client

## üåü Overview
MoviesApp is an Android application designed to fetch and display movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) using Retrofit. The app offers a smooth and engaging user experience with a Home screen showcasing top-rated, popular, and upcoming movies, and a Search feature for finding specific titles. With a focus on clean architecture, the app leverages coroutines for asynchronous operations, and Picasso for efficient image loading.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
The project is organized to efficiently manage the retrieval and display of movie data from TMDb:

### Key Components

#### `MainActivity`
- **Manages the main navigation and UI setup of the app.**
- Integrates an `AnimatedBottomBar` for seamless navigation between the `HomeFragment` and `SearchFragment`.
- Initializes and sets up the fragments on launch.

#### `HomeFragment`
- **Displays lists of top-rated, popular, and upcoming movies.**
- Uses a `ViewPager` for showcasing top-rated movies in a banner at the top.
- Features horizontal `RecyclerView`s for popular and upcoming movies, with infinite scrolling support.
- Navigates to `DetailActivity` when a movie is selected.

#### `SearchFragment`
- **Allows users to search for movies.**
- Utilizes a `RecyclerView` with a `GridLayoutManager` to display search results.
- Handles user input to query TMDb for matching movies.
- Supports click events to navigate to `DetailActivity` for more details on selected movies.

#### `MoviesAdapter`
- **Handles the display of movie data in `RecyclerView`s.**
- Manages the loading of movie posters using Picasso.
- Handles item clicks to trigger navigation to `DetailActivity`.

#### `BannerAdapter`
- **Manages the display of top-rated movies in a `ViewPager`.**
- Facilitates smooth swiping between movie banners.

#### `RetrofitService`
- **Manages network operations with TMDb using Retrofit.**
- Configures `OkHttpClient` with appropriate timeouts and API key handling via `AuthInterceptor`.
- Provides an instance of `TheMovieDBAPI` to perform API requests.

#### `TheMovieDBAPI`
- **Defines API endpoints for TMDb.**
- Contains methods for retrieving top-rated, popular, and upcoming movies, as well as searching for movies by query.
